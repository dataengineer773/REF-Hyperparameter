As Important Hyperparameter for algorithm is the number of features to select, In Practice, we cannot know the best number of feature to select with RFE, instead it is good practice to test different values 
demonstrate selecting different numbers of features from 2 to 10 on the synthetic binary classification dataset, first reports the mean accuracy for each configured number of input features and we see that 
performance improves as the number of features increase and perhaps peaks around 4-to-7 as we might expect, given that only five features are relevant to the target variable and in the next step A box and 
whisker plot for distribution of accuracy scores for each configured number of features.
